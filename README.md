# Linked-List
In my node file there is a practical implementation of linked lists with various functionalities. The Node class serves as the building block for creating linked lists, and the main program provides a user interface to interact with the linked lists.

Node Class
The Node class represents a node in the linked list and contains the following attributes:

data: Integer value representing the data stored in the node.
next: Reference to the next node in the list.
size: Static variable representing the size of the list.
The class includes methods for creating default lists, displaying lists, calculating the sum of elements, reversing the list, and more.

User Interface
The program offers a user interface for performing various operations on linked lists, such as:

Empty Default List: Clear the linked list.
Insert New Element: Add a new element to the sorted list.
Delete Existing Element: Remove an element from the list.
Display List: Print the elements of the list.
Replace Element: Replace an element at a specified position.
Sum of Elements: Calculate the sum of all elements in the list.
Reverse List: Reverse the order of elements in the list.
Display Sublist: Show a sublist based on user-defined start and end positions.
Operations with 2 Lists: Perform operations like concatenation and copying between two lists.
Exit: Terminate the program.
## Lab-Tasks
- In the remaining files, organized by numbered questions, you will find the code that I developed during my weekly lab sessions, focusing specifically on linked list implementations.
